# Huffman Implementation in MATLAB

simple project to learn how the huffman algorithm works and implement the 3 functions
huffmanDict, huffmanEnc and huffmanDec.
## Executing Program

Code written in Matlab, version 2021b. The dictionary takes the probabilities either
from counting the occurences of letters from the input file cvxopt.txt or from the 
frequencies.txt file which has the probabilities of each letter in the english language.

All functions are run from the runfile.m
